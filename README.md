# Group-17
We will create a mobile app which will allow the user to control his car with his phone and set it in autonomous mode when he needs/wants to.

**Why?**
- A lot of drivers are lazy.
- Drivers who are on a trip might get tired and want to rest for a bit (that’s where the autonomous mode comes in)


**How?**
- We are going to use the car’s sensors to detect obstacles and make the adjustments that are necessary to stop/have the car avoid it before collision.
- In order to remotely control the car, a simple controller (in the app) will be created.


**The technology we're gonna use:**
- Arduino car
- SMCE emulator, SmartCar API, Arduino IDE
- C++, Kotlin, Java, Android Studio
